    Classes necessary to run a server.
    <p>
    The classes in this package provide the foundation of the SalSSuite server.
    The {@link salssuite.server.Server} class itself provides a framework
    for modules which have to be added to its source code to be included in the
    SalSSuite. For details on what it does, please refer to its documentation.
    <p>
    This server can be launched using the {@link salssuite.server.ServerLauncher}.
    It provides a <code>main()</code> method which starts the server and performs
    steps to rescue as much of the data as possible if the server crashes.
    <p>
    A {@link salssuite.server.Project} represents one real 'Schule als Staat'
    project and can be seen as a basic configuration for the server. It is
    set up by the user upon server startup using a
    {@link salssuite.server.gui.ProjectSetupDialog}.
    <p>
    The GUI for all parts of the server is contained in the
    <code>salssuite.server.gui</code> package.
