    Basic server GUI. The classes in this package provide the GUI of a server
    without any modules. The term 'module' is explained in the documentation of the
    {@link salssuite.server.module.Module} interface and the
    <code>salssuite.server.module</code> package.
    <p>
    The {@link salssuite.server.gui.ServerGUI} is the central
    <code>JFrame</code> representing a server.
    It is mainly a wrapper for the <code>ServerPanel</code> and all the module
    panels.
    <p>
    Using the {@link salssuite.server.gui.ServerPanel}, the user can do basic
    server administration such as generating output, saving the server's data,
    or managing user accounts. The latter is done through the
    {@link salssuite.server.gui.AccountManagingGUI} which provides
    an interface to the user account system. This GUI may be 'launched' from
    the <code>ServerPanel</code> and is not intended as a standalone component.
    <p>
    The dialogs in this package are merely helper dialogs for the various
    other GUI classes.
    <p>
    For details on the account management system, please refer to the
    <code>Server</code>'s documentation.
