    Panels for all the modules. Every module can (but needs not) define a
    panel which is added to the {@link salssuite.server.gui.ServerGUI} when
    the server starts. These panels go into this package (but not the clients).
    <p>
    A module panel will usually provide actions which are rather uncommon
    or intended only for few people with special rights. Common actions
    should be implemented using clients to make them available on several
    machines instead of having lots of people competing for the server's
    keyboard.
    <p>
    For a general description on what a module is and does, please refer
    to the documentation of the {@link salssuite.server.module.Module} interface
    and the <code>salssuite.server.module</code> package.
    <p>
    The dialogs in this package are simple helper components for the panels.
