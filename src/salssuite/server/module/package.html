    All the server modules.

    A module is one part of the server that is responsible for a certain aspect
    of 'Schule als Staat', for example the magazine. A module will usually
    have one or more of the following tasks:
    <ul>
        <li>Extend the database and provide new tables for some sort
        of data that is needed in addition to the data provided by the
        server. See {@link salssuite.server.module.Module#buildDatabase} and {@link
        salssuite.server.Server#buildServerDatabase}.</li>
        <li>Provide a user GUI for a certain aspect of the system.
        Modules can have so called 'module panels' which are added
        to the {@link salssuite.server.gui.ServerGUI} by the server.
        They provide functionality which usually only few organisators
        should have access to. (Otherwise a client would be preferred.) All
        panels can be found in the <code>salssuite.server.module.gui</code>
        package. See {@link salssuite.server.module.Module#getPanel}.</li>
        <li>Generate useful output for the user. Every module can define
        output files which the user could find interesting, and generate
        them at server shutdown or when the user requests it. See
        {@link salssuite.server.module.Module#makeOutput}.</li>
    </ul>
    A module can, but needs not be associated with a client.
    <p>
    This package contains all modules of the SalSSuite
    server, as well as the generic {@link salssuite.server.module.Module} interface.
    The latter defines what makes up a server module in general, and all the other
    classes in this package are implementations for certain aspects of a project.
    See their respective documentations for details.
