    Utility classes used by all clients. The actual clients can be found
    in their respective packages under <code>salssuite.client.*</code>
    <p>
    The {@link salssuite.clients.ConnectDialog} is a dialog that clients
    can use to try and connect to a user-specified server. All clients use
    it to let the user determine the IP address and port of the server to
    connect to as well as the username and password the user wants to
    authenticate with.
    <p>
    The {@link salssuite.clients.Converter} is rather
    itself a client, but as it will usually not be used alone it is not located
    in its own client package. It provides the user with the possibility to
    'convert' some attributes of citizens and companies to each other, f.ex.
    a citizen's ID to their name or a company's name to its ID.
