    Classes related to the magazine client.
    <p>
    The <code>JFrame MagazineClient</code> and its
    <code>MagazineClientXXXPanel</code>s make up the magazine client for the
    SalSSuite. The two dialogs are used for special sorts of user interaction.
    <p>
    The magazine client is divided up into a main frame (<code>MagazineClient</code>)
    and three top-level panels (<code>MagazineClientOrdersPanel;
    MagazineClientShoppingListPanel; MagazineClientWarePanel</code>), two of
    which in turn have sub-panels.
    The frame is a simple wrapper around the panels; they do the actual interaction
    with the user.
    <p>
    For a general description of what can be done with the magazine client,
    please refer to its {@link salssuite.clients.magazine.MagazineClient
    documentation}. More detailed information is given in the javadoc of
    {@link salssuite.clients.magazine.MagazineClientOrdersPanel},
    {@link salssuite.clients.magazine.MagazineClientShoppingListPanel}, and
